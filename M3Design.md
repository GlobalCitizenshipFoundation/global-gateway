# Material Design 3 (M3) Design Specifications

*(Material Design 3 + WCAG 2.1 Compliant)*

This document outlines the strict Material Design 3 (M3) specifications to be followed for all UI/UX design and implementation within the Global Gateway application. It serves as a comprehensive guide to ensure consistency, accessibility, and a modern aesthetic across the platform.

## 🌱 Foundations

### Colors

* Brand seed (`#E91E63`)
* Light & dark palettes (tokens: primary, secondary, tertiary, error, neutral)
* Contrast validation rules (WCAG AA)
* Usage rules (primary actions, background surfaces, accents, status colors)

### Typography

* Font family (Inter / Roboto Flex)
* Type scale table (Display → Headline → Title → Body → Label)
* Usage guidelines (case, readability, accessibility)

### Shape & Elevation

* Corner radius levels (4, 8, 16, 50%)
* Elevation tokens (0–5)
* Shadows & overlays in dark theme

### Layout & Spacing

* 8px baseline grid
* Breakpoints: xs (360), sm (600), md (960), lg (1280), xl (1600)
* Responsive behavior (navigation, cards, forms, dashboards)
* Density modes: comfortable vs compact (for data-heavy screens)

### Iconography & Imagery

* Icon set: Material Symbols (outlined/filled usage)
* Avatar rules (shapes, initials fallback, alt text)
* Illustrations/imagery: style, do’s/don’ts
* Fallbacks when icons/images disabled

---

## 🎛️ Components

### Actions

* Buttons (primary, secondary, tonal, FAB, icon buttons)
* Chips (filter, input, choice, action)
* Toggles (switches, checkboxes, radio buttons)

### Inputs & Forms

* Text fields (filled/outlined, states, validation)
* Selects, dropdowns, comboboxes
* Date pickers, file uploaders
* Form grouping (progressive disclosure, multi-step)
* Validation: live, on blur, on submit

### Navigation

* Top app bar
* Navigation drawer (permanent, modal)
* Bottom navigation (mobile)
* Breadcrumbs
* Tabs & segmented controls

### Surfaces

* Cards (anatomy, content structure)
* Sheets (modal, bottom, side)
* Dialogs (modal, alert, confirmation)
* Banners, snackbars, tooltips

### Data Display

* Tables (sortable, filterable, sticky headers)
* Lists (single/multi-line, with avatars/icons)
* Badges, progress indicators
* Charts (bar, line, pie → with accessible text fallback)

### Feedback

* States: success, warning, error, info
* Loaders (spinners, skeletons, shimmer)
* Notification hierarchy (toast → snackbar → banner → modal)

---

## ⚙️ Interaction Design

### Universal Interaction Rules

* Touch targets ≥ 44x44px
* Focus states (2px ring, brand color)
* Hover/pressed/disabled states
* Keyboard navigation patterns (tab, enter, space, arrow)

### Navigation Behavior

* Responsive drawer → collapses on smaller screens
* Skip links for accessibility
* Search & filter flows

### Forms Interaction

* Error handling (inline, summary, aria-describedby)
* Multi-step forms (with progress indicator)
* Save/resume flows

### Bulk & Workflow Actions

* Multi-select + bulk actions (approve, reject, move)
* Drag & drop with keyboard alternatives
* Audit trails (logging and activity history)

---

## 🎞️ Motion

### Motion Tokens

* Durations: short (80–120ms), medium (200–240ms), long (320–400ms)
* Easing: decelerate in, accelerate out

### Motion Patterns

* Navigation transitions
* State changes (ripple, color, scale)
* Hierarchy (elevation + scaling)
* Kanban card reordering

### Accessibility

* Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
* Replace translations with opacity fades

---

## ♿ Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Contrast & Color

* All text meets ≥ 4.5:1
* Non-text UI elements ≥ 3:1
* Color not sole means of communication

### Keyboard & Screen Reader

* Logical tab order
* Focus visible at all times
* ARIA roles for all interactive components

### Dynamic Content

* `aria-live` for updates
* Alerts for critical feedback
* Announce validation errors

### Multilingual & RTL Support

* RTL mirroring (Arabic, Hebrew)
* Multi-script typography (CJK, Devanagari)
* Date/time/currency localization

---

## 📊 Patterns

### Workflows & Pipelines (Recruiting / Fellowship)

* Kanban-style boards (list/listitem roles)
* Drag & drop with keyboard equivalents
* Announcements (“Moved to Interview, position 2”)

### Dashboards

* Grid layout with resizable widgets
* Chart accessibility (summaries + export to table)
* User customization (add/remove widgets)

### Profiles

* Profile card anatomy (avatar, name, pronouns, metadata)
* Editable fields inline (Save/Cancel patterns)
* Multi-language name handling

### Search & Filters

* Faceted search
* Clear all filters pattern
* Accessible advanced search

### Multi-Step Flows

* Progress trackers
* Save & resume drafts
* Confirmation/review screens

---

## ✍️ Content & Language

* Voice & tone (professional, inclusive, plain language)
* Labels & microcopy (short, action-oriented)
* Error messaging (actionable, non-blaming)
* Writing for accessibility (avoid jargon, expand acronyms)
* Localization guardrails (avoid cultural references, idioms)

---

## 🎨 Theming & Customization

* Multi-tenant theming (logo, accent colors)
* Guardrails (cannot change contrast ratios, core type scale)
* Token system (export as CSS vars, JSON, Figma tokens)
* Branding tiers:

  * Core theme (enforced accessibility)
  * Tenant theme (logos, accents, illustrations)

---

## 🧪 Testing & QA

### Automated Testing

* Lighthouse CI (≥ 90 accessibility score)
* axe-core integration
* Contrast checker across all tokens

### Manual Testing

* Keyboard-only navigation
* Screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
* RTL + localization testing

### Performance & Resilience

* Progressive enhancement (offline save drafts)
* Lazy loading dashboards, prefetch forms
* Low-bandwidth image handling

---

## 🏛 Governance & Contribution

* Versioning system (tokens/components)
* Change approval workflow (design council, dev review)
* Contribution model (how to propose changes)
* Documentation updates required with each release
* Tooling: Figma library, Storybook components, token sync pipeline
