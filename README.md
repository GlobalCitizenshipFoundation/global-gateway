# Global Gateway
A Unified Platform for Programs, Fellowships, Hiring, and Awards Management

1. Introduction

The Global Citizenship Foundation (GCF) manages a wide range of programs — including fellowships, leadership development initiatives, awards, grants, hiring, and training programs. Each of these requires a structured application, evaluation, scheduling, and decision-making process.

Currently, GCF uses a mix of tools (forms, spreadsheets, emails, HR platforms), which creates challenges:

Fragmentation: Information spread across multiple systems.

Manual Workload: High dependency on staff effort to coordinate processes.

Limited Transparency: Applicants and evaluators lack clarity on status and timelines.

Inconsistent Experience: Processes vary by program, leading to confusion and inefficiencies.

Global Gateway addresses these challenges by creating a single organizational platform that enables GCF teams to design, run, and monitor all programs under one unified system.

Think of it as Submittable + Workable + Personio + SurveyMonkey Apply, but purpose-built for GCF’s mission and operations.

2. Core Purpose & Value Proposition

Purpose: To streamline how GCF designs and manages programs, creating a consistent, fair, and scalable digital process for all stakeholders.

Value Proposition for GCF:

Efficiency – Reduce duplication and manual tasks through automation.

Transparency – Real-time visibility for applicants, evaluators, and managers.

Fairness – Structured rubrics, anonymization, and standardized workflows.

Flexibility – Configurable pathways for fellowships, hiring, awards, or training.

User-Centric – Tailored dashboards and smooth experience for each role.

Organizational Alignment – Multi-team collaboration in one shared environment.

3. Platform Architecture: Key Modules

Global Gateway is modular and configurable, allowing GCF to use the same system for diverse program types:

3.1 Program & Campaign Management

Pathway Templates for repeatable workflows (e.g., Application → Screening → Review → Interview → Decision).

Unified Campaign Dashboard for managers to monitor all active programs.

3.2 Dynamic Application Forms

Drag-and-drop form builder with rich fields (text, files, references, essays, repeaters).

Conditional logic for personalized application experiences.

Validation rules for structured, high-quality data.

Multilingual form support for global applicants.

3.3 Evaluation & Review Management

Screening for eligibility (checklists, pass/fail).

Review for deeper scoring using weighted rubrics.

Rubric Library for consistent evaluation criteria across programs.

Assignment Tools for reviewers, with load balancing and conflict-of-interest flags.

Collaboration settings: blind, anonymous, or transparent review modes.

3.4 Scheduling & Interview Coordination

Host-Managed Availability: reviewers define their recurring slots.

Campaign-Managed Slots: program defines fixed slots.

Integrated applicant self-booking with timezone adjustments.

Configurable decision categories (e.g., Accepted, Waitlist, Rejected).

Applicant dashboards with live status updates.

Automation Rules to trigger next steps (emails, phase transitions).

3.7 User & Role Management

Role-based access: Applicant, Program Manager, Reviewer, Screener, Scheduling Host, Admin.

Multi-team support for different GCF units.

Central directory with permissions and availability controls.

3.8 Communication & Notifications

Email and in-app notifications tied to workflow events.

Template library for consistent communications.

Bulk messaging for campaign updates.

3.9 Reporting & Insights

Built-in dashboards for applications, evaluations, and diversity metrics.

Export to CSV/Excel for advanced offline analysis.

Program comparison reports across campaigns for leadership oversight.

4. Target Users at GCF

Applicants: students, professionals, researchers — complete applications, track progress, receive updates.

Program Managers: design workflows, oversee processes, assign reviewers, monitor progress.

Screeners/Reviewers: assess applications fairly and efficiently using structured tools.

Interview Hosts: manage availability and conduct applicant interviews.

Administrators & Leadership: monitor cross-program performance, ensure compliance, and analyze data for strategy.

5. Technology Stack

Frontend: React + Next.js (TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui).

Backend: Next.js API routes + Supabase (auth, database, real-time sync, edge functions).

Integrations: Email (SendGrid), SMS (Twilio), Calendar (Google/Outlook).

Security: Role-based access control, encrypted data, GDPR-compliant storage.

6. Benefits for GCF

Unified System – replaces multiple tools with one platform.

Consistency – all programs use standardized workflows.

Time Savings – automation reduces staff workload.

Fair & Transparent Evaluations – structured rubrics, bias reduction.

Scalable Growth – supports new programs, cohorts, or hiring rounds easily.

Improved Applicant Experience – clear, responsive, and user-friendly journey.

7. Roadmap for Expansion

Phase 1: Core modules (applications, evaluations, decisions, communication).

Phase 2: Scheduling, recommendations, advanced reporting.

Phase 3: AI features (reviewer assignment, smart applicant matching).

Phase 4: External integrations (HR systems, CRM, LMS).

Phase 5: Digital credentialing (blockchain-based certificates).

8. Conclusion

Global Gateway will be the central nervous system for the Global Citizenship Foundation’s programs, fellowships, hiring, and awards. By consolidating application and evaluation processes, it ensures efficiency, fairness, and clarity for all stakeholders.

This platform is not just a tool — it’s an enabler of organizational alignment and global scalability, positioning GCF to manage its expanding portfolio with professionalism, transparency, and impact.

Your task is to design and build the Global Gateway app in strict alignment with the guidelines outlined in AI_Rules.md. To accelerate development, you may reference the features from @Global Gateway App 3.0, but do not copy code directly (as it may be corrupt or error-prone). Instead, use it only as a functional benchmark.

The system must be developed with an emphasis on:

Modularity – Components and services should be reusable and maintainable.

Clean Architecture – Ensure separation of concerns, clear domain boundaries, and scalability.

User-Centric Design – Each end-user role should have a tailored interface and journey, including:

Applicants

Hiring Managers & Recruiters

Program Managers

Administrators

As a first step, draft a comprehensive architecture plan, guided by the Vertical Implementation Strategy (VIS.md). The plan should clearly define:

Core modules and how they interconnect.

Role-based interfaces and user flows.

Service layers (frontend, backend, APIs, database).

Extensibility strategy to support future features (e.g., analytics, AI-driven evaluations).
